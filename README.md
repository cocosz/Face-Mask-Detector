# Face-Mask-Detector

This is a project to detect face masks.For this purpose we have used a kaggle dataset.We have used mobilenet_v2 for this purpose in order to allow faster and effective user experience.Having trained the model, we have then made use opencv library to get live feed.The faces are detected based on training and classified into "mask" and "no mask".
Before this, we have also tested it on images.Now you can see the webcam starts as it starts detecting, an surrounds the face with a green rectangle labelled as "mask" and if not with a red one written as "no mask".The link to the dataset is given below.
